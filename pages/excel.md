You know you can't move on like this.
People are making mistakes, status reports take too long,
there are multiple versions of critical data out there
and every week brings more Excel sheets.

<p class="intro">Convert Excel sheets to modern, scalable, web applications</p>

In many industries Excel has taken on much more than it was ever meant to deal with.
Replacing those Excel sheets with "real software" is expensive and risky,
as is upgrading legacy software.

<a name="convert"></a>
We've created the missing link between what we think of as "applications" and Excel sheets.
M-industries can help you make "real software" without the investment and risk,
using tools that are as easy, or easier, to use as Excel.

- Centralize a single truth about critical data
- Collaborate with multiple users
- Accessible on any device, from anywhere
- Improve and then ensure data quality
- Formalize hidden rules and secret pitfalls
- Our applications can both read from and write to Excel,
  making the transition completely seamless.
