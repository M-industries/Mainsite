<a name="info"></a>
We spent 15 years researching a new way of building software,
not through programming but completely driven by data models.

<p class="intro">M-industries software is different.</p>

We call our programming language and technology **"Alan"**

In Alan the data-model drives everything.
The unique modeling language allows you to write a model that generates
both a database design and a user interface.

This method is fast and iterates fast, like creating something in Excel would.
However, Alan ensures data accuracy and consistency and scales up to enterprise level.

The Alan project has its own website, with more details about
the language and the systems that it supports.

Go to the [Alan micro-site](https://alan-platform.com) to learn more.
