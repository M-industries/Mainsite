<a name="info"></a>
We spent 15 years researching a new way of building software,
not through programming but completely driven by data models.

<p class="intro">M-industries software is different.</p>

We call our programming language and technology **"Alan"**

In Alan the data-model drives everything.
The unique modeling language allows you to write a model that generates
both a database design and a user interface.

This method is fast and iterates fast, like creating something in Excel would.
However, Alan ensures data accuracy and consistency and scales up to enterprise level.

## Replace Excel

We're on a mission to create the missing link
between what we think of as "applications" and Excel sheets.
In many industries Excel has taken on much more than it was ever meant to deal with.
Replacing those Excel sheets with "real software" is expensive and risky,
as is upgrading legacy software.

M-industries can help you make "real software" without the investment and risk,
using tools that are as easy, or easier, to use as Excel.

And because it's so easy to iterate on Alan applications, you don't have to do everything
at once like you would when migrating to new applications.
We bet you don't want to hear the word "migrate" or "roll-out" anymore either.
